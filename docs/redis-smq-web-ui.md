# RedisSMQ Web UI

The RedisSMQ Web UI is a dedicated project that provides a user-friendly interface for managing RedisSMQ, streamlining queue management and monitoring processes for improved efficiency.

## Key Features
* **Monitoring**: Easily monitor your RedisSMQ queues via an intuitive web interface, allowing for real-time visibility into queue activity and performance.
* **Management**: Simplify queue management with a range of tools and features designed to optimize your workflow, including queue creation, message management, and configuration settings.

## Compatibility and System Requirements
Please note that the current version of the RedisSMQ Web UI is compatible with RedisSMQ v7. Unfortunately, it does not currently support RedisSMQ v8. We recommend checking the system requirements before installation to ensure seamless integration.

## Roadmap and Future Development
We are actively working on the next generation of the RedisSMQ Web UI, which will support RedisSMQ v8 and introduce new features and enhancements. Stay tuned for updates.

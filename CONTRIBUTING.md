# Contributions

If you want to make any project better, your contributions are very welcome!

## Pull requests

It is best to open an issue in GitHub about what you want to implement / change or to suggest new features.

Before submitting any pull request please make sure that your code does not stick out and consistent with the project
coding style. You can check the status of your coding style by simply running `npm run lint`.

Cover your code with new tests if needed. Only fully tested changes are accepted.

Each time when you are ready to submit your changes don't forget to run `npm test` to check that your code is complying
with eslint project rules and that all of the tests are successfully completed.

## Bugs

If you find any bugs, please do not hesitate to open an issue in GitHub including the case to reproduce the bug
when possible.

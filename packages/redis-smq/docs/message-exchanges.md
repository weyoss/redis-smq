# Message Exchanges

Starting with version 7.1.0, RedisSMQ introduces message exchanges, which provide flexible routing methods for
directing messages to one or more queues.

A message exchange functions as an address or routing algorithm that determines the destinations for a message.

Each message must be associated with a message exchange, which enables the producer to identify the list of queues that
correspond to the exchange parameters.

Subsequently, the producer directly publishes the message to the matched queues.

When a message is sent to multiple queues, a unique message is created for each queue with the same properties as the
original message, but each will have a different ID. All messages that are created and published to multiple queues
through a specific message exchange share a common Exchange Tag.

The Exchange Tag serves as a unique identifier to track all messages published to the identified queues at the moment
of publication.

RedisSMQ supports three exchange types out of the box:

## 1. Direct Exchange

![RedisSMQ Direct Exchange](redis-smq-direct-exchange.png)

A direct exchange allows producers to send a message to a specific queue that exactly matches the designated exchange
queue.

The queue can be specified as a string (e.g., `a.b.c.d`) or as an object that describes the queue's namespace
`{ ns: 'my-app', name: 'a.b.c.d'}`. If a string is provided, RedisSMQ will utilize the default namespace.

For example, a direct exchange targeting the queue `a.b.c.d` will only match the queue named exactly as `a.b.c.d`.

### Usage

To configure a direct exchange for a message, use the [ProducibleMessage Class](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md) and the method [ProducibleMessage.setQueue()](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md#setqueue):

```typescript
const { ProducibleMessage } = require('redis-smq');

const msg = new ProducibleMessage();
msg.setQueue('a.b.c.d').setBody('123456789');
```

When publishing a message with a direct exchange, if the target queue does not exist, the message will not be sent, and an error will be returned.

To retrieve the list of queues associated with a direct exchange, utilize [ExchangeDirect.getQueues()](api/classes/ExchangeDirect.md#getqueues).

## 2. Topic Exchange

![RedisSMQ Topic Exchange](redis-smq-topic-exchange.png)

A topic exchange allows messages to be published to one or multiple queues that match a specified topic pattern.

The topic pattern is a string composed of alphanumeric characters, including - and \_, separated by periods (.).

For instance, the topic pattern a.b.c.d will match the following queues: a.b.c.d, a.b.c.d.e, and a.b.c.d.e.f, but it
will not match a.b, a.b.c, or a.b.c.z.

A topic pattern can also be represented as an object to denote the namespace:

```javascript
{ ns: 'my-app', topic: 'a.b.c.d' }
```

This will match all queues within the my-app namespace that satisfy the a.b.c.d pattern. If no namespace is specified, the default namespace will be applied.

### Usage

To set up a topic exchange for a message, use the [ProducibleMessage Class](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md) and the method [ProducibleMessage.setTopic()](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md#settopic):

```javascript
const { ProducibleMessage } = require('redis-smq');

const msg = new ProducibleMessage();
msg.setTopic('a.b.c.d').setBody('123456789');
```

If the topic pattern does not correspond to any queues, the message will be deleted and an error will be generated.

To fetch the list of queues associated with a topic exchange, employ [ExchangeTopic.getQueues()](api/classes/ExchangeTopic.md#getqueues).

- [ExchangeTopic Class](api/classes/ExchangeTopic.md)

## FanOut Exchange

![RedisSMQ FanOut Exchange](redis-smq-fanout-exchange.png)

A FanOut exchange enables producers to publish a message to all queues that are bound to the exchange via a binding key.
Usage

To use a FanOut exchange, you must first create it via [ExchangeFanOut.saveExchange()](api/classes/ExchangeFanOut.md#saveexchange) and then bind one or more queues to the exchange through ExchangeFanOut.bindQueue().

To set up a FanOut exchange for a message, the [ProducibleMessage API](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md) utilizes [ProducibleMessage.setFanOut()](api/classes/ProducibleMessage.md#setfanout):

```javascript
const { ProducibleMessage } = require('redis-smq');

const msg = new ProducibleMessage();

// Assuming that my-FanOut-exchange already exists
msg.setFanOut('my-FanOut-exchange').setBody('123456789');
```

When publishing with a FanOut exchange, if the exchange does not exist or no queues are associated, the message will be discarded and an error returned.

To find out which queues are associated with a FanOut exchange, use [ExchangeFanOut.getQueues()](api/classes/ExchangeFanOut.md#getqueues).

Additionally, FanOut exchanges can be managed through the [HTTP API Interface](https://github.com/weyoss/redis-smq-monitor) or via a browser using the [Web UI](https://github.com/weyoss/redis-smq-monitor-client).

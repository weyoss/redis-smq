[![Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/weyoss/redis-smq?flag=redis-smq-common&style=flat-square)](https://app.codecov.io/github/weyoss/redis-smq/tree/master/packages/redis-smq-common)

A shared foundation for the RedisSMQ ecosystem. 
This package provides essential components and utilities used by RedisSMQ and related packages, helping you configure 
Redis clients, structure logging, and reuse core types across the stack.

- Used by: `redis-smq`, `redis-smq-rest-api`, `redis-smq-web-server`, and `redis-smq-web-ui`
- Node.js 20+ is required

## Features

- Core types and utilities shared across RedisSMQ packages
- Configuration helpers and enums (e.g., select Redis client implementation)
- Logging interfaces and a Console logger implementation
- Redis client abstractions and guidance for supported clients
- File-based synchronization primitives (e.g., FileLock)
- Thorough documentation for server/client setup and usage

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
npm install redis-smq-common
# or
pnpm add redis-smq-common
```

This package works with multiple Redis clients. Install one of the supported clients based on your needs:

- ioredis (recommended for advanced features)

```shell
npm install ioredis
```

- @redis/client (official Redis client)

```shell
npm install @redis/client
```

Note: Redis clients are optional peer dependencies; pick one and configure it in your application.

## Version compatibility

Always use matching versions of the RedisSMQ packages across your project to avoid runtime/API mismatches. 
See the monorepo documentation for Version Compatibility guidance.
